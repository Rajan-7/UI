        CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a fundamental technology in web
        development that defines the visual presentation of HTML documents,
        enabling the precise control of elements' layout, color, typography, and
        more. It plays a pivotal role in the aesthetics and user experience of
        websites, allowing developers to create responsive, aesthetically
        pleasing designs. Through selectors and properties, CSS empowers
        designers to style web content, whether it's adjusting text size and
        color or arranging page elements in a visually pleasing manner.
